Bandstructure from scratch using a structure file
-------------------------------------------------

*       **Initiate Bandstructure module:**

        Bandstructure module can be initiated from CASCADE toolbar by clicking XXX icon.

                CINEMAS: Connections and file-transfer between local machine and remote server with multiple hops through several gateways.

All the automatic modules within CINEMAS always look for at least an active connection established to a remote server.
However, workflows and input files therein can be created automatically, but to be submitted manually.

                Module looking for an active connection to a remote server.

*       **Load the structure:**

        Browse a single or multiple structure file(s) from disk. In the current version of CINEMAS supported structure
        file formats are :math:`\texttt{POSCAR/*.vasp/*.cif/*.in/*.xsf}`.

*       **Settings for input-files:**

                Snapshot of window showing CINEMAS **default** settings to prepare rest of the input files.

        - In :numref:`band3_band`, the first field is a list of established(if any) connections.
        - In 'default' mode workflow is submitted automatically to a connection marked as default in *connection* workspace.
        - In *default* mode, all the setting fields will be disabled and show parameters in 'read-only' mode.
        - Setting-mode has to be changed to *user* mode to make customized settings.
        - In the *user* mode of settings, remote server can be selected from a list of established connections as show in the figure below.
        - As well as all the setting fields can be set to desired parameters.
        - Additionally *Save* and *Load* buttons are enabled, and can be used to save user-settings as a template or to load a saved one.

*       **Automatic creation of high symmetry k-path in Brillouin Zone**

        - For bandstructure calculations CINEMAS module automatically chooses k-path in Brillouin zone and writes to a :math:`\texttt{KPOINTS}` (for VASP) file.
        - This is performed by utilizing `HighSymmKpath <https://pymatgen.org/pymatgen.symmetry.bandstructure.html#pymatgen.symmetry.bandstructure.HighSymmKpath>`_ class of pymatgen.symmetry.bandstructure module.
*       **Automatic creation of workflows:**

        - Once settings-mode is defined/selected, workflows are created automatically.
        - CINEMAS Bandstructure module includes a relaxation and a dependent band-structure calculation.
        - By default *relaxation* workflow is shown collapsed, while *band* one is expanded(:numref:`band5`).
        - However can be expanded at user's choice(:numref:`band6`).
        - A single band module can have a single structure(:numref:`band5`, :numref:`band6`) or multiple(:numref:`band7`, :numref:`band8`) structures.

                :align: center
                :scale: 80%

                By default, *Relax* workflow is collapsed.

                :name: band6
                :align: center

                *Relax* workflow can be expanded by double click.

*       **Post-process bandstructure:**

        - Once over, a quick-view of bandstructure will be available from *Snapshot* workspace.

                Quick-view of bandstructure plot from **Snapshot** workspace.

        - The button |plot| redirects to *Analysis* workspace for a user-customized bandstructure plot and to prepare publication-quality figures.

Bandstructure from a blank template
-------------------------------------

        .. figure:: _static/band12.png
                :name: band12
                :align: center
                :scale: 80%

                A blank template of Bandstructure module.

        - Alternatively, as shown in :numref:`band1` option of empty template can be selected.
        - A blank template of bandstructure module is created(:numref:`band12`).
        - Other workflows can be imported inside these templates, by:

                - Copy/Paste method.
                - Drag and drop other workflows.
                - Select a empty workflow of blank template, and import a calculation from disk into it.
