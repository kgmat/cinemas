CINEMAS-draw is an integrated tool of CINEMAS, where users can prepare figures for publication or otherwise. CINEMAS-draw can be used as 
a standalone application to prepare figures from scratch, or the graphics can be exported from CINEMAS-view and CINEMAS-plot directly and 
further drawings can me made. 

CINEMAS-draw can export graphics in jpg/png formats with up-to 20X scaling, as well as vector formats like ps/eps/pdf.

CINEMAS-draw is not just a basic 'paint' application, some features are:

- Special character and mathematical symbols available through GUI.
- Mathematical equation(characters based) can be inserted through GUI.
- Mathematical equation(Latex based) can be inserted. A separate Latex installation is required.
- Drawings are object based. Once drawn, elements can be moved, dragged or repositioned(powerpoint style).  
- Drawing elements are depth enabled. For multiple superposed elements, can be brought to front or sent to back.
- Multiple drawings can be made in tab arrangement, and can be saved on consolidated CINEMAS project.

One can navigate to CINEMAS-draw using 'Drawer' button as shown below:

.. figure:: _static/nav_2_drawer.png
   :alt: nav_2_drawer
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Navigate to CINEMAS-draw.

Users can start afresh from CINEMAS-draw or use |2draw| button, from CINEMAS-view(including its Fermi-surface utility) or CINEMAS-plot toolbar 
to export graphics from there and further draw on them or use them.

.. figure:: _static/draw_from_view.png
   :alt: draw_from_view
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Export graphics from CINEMAS-view.

.. figure:: _static/draw_from_plot.png
   :alt: draw_from_plot
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Export graphics from CINEMAS-plot.

Figures can be prepared by mixing several graphics from CINEMAS-view or CINEMAS-plot. One such example is shown below:

   Exporting and mixing graphics from CINEMAS-plot and CINEMAS-view, to prepare a figure.

Drawings can be made in CINEMAS-draw by:

- Starting from a blank page using the icon |new_draw| from CINEMAS-draw toolbar.

OR

- Exporting graphics from CINEMAS-view/Fermi-surface/CINEMAS-plot by clicking the icon |export_2_draw| from their respective toolbar.

The following is CINEMAS-draw parent window, and multiple drawings can be created in multiple *tabs*, and all of them 
can be saved in main CINEMAS project file.

        Snapshot of CINEMAS-draw window.

**From the toolbar:**

- Add a blank page within CINEMAS-draw by clicking  |new_draw|  icon.
- A click on this button creates a new tab with a blank canvas.
- Images from disk can be inserted by clicking the icon |insert_draw|.
- A shape from the list can be selected and drawn on the canvas, using the icon |shapes_menu|
- **Style Options** provides properties console, as shown in :numref:`latex1`.

        Available shapes actually drawn on the canvas. 
        Click on the image for its original size and resolution.

- An area on the canvas can be selected for various purposes by using the icon |rubber_select|.
- Images can be cropped to the selected area by using the icon |crop_draw|.
- Images can be saved to file with several formats like JPG/PNG/EPS/PS/PDF.
- Scaling up-to 30X is available for raster(JPG/PNG) formats.

**Available properties are:**

- Line properties.
- Color(Fill/font) properties.
- Rotation properties.
- Shadow properties with gradient control.
- Polygon corner rounding.
- Transparent drawings(remove BG).
- Depth control of objects(bring to front/send to back). See :numref:`depth_ctrl`.
- Insert Latex snippet, See :numref:`latex1`, :numref:`latex2`.
