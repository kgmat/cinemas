*CINEMAS-plot* is an integrated component to plot numerical data as graphs of several types, at par with a stand-alone plotting application. 
*CINEMAS-plot* be envoked directly or through *Analysis*-workspace |plot|, from the CASCADE workflows.

CINEMAS-plot has a table-and-graph layout, where user has control over the table as well as the graph. Data can be imported as a table, from 
file(s) in .dat or .csv format(as in latest version of CINEMAS). A number of mathematical functions can be operated on columns, to modify 
the table. 

CINEMAS-plot tables
====================

Tables in CINEMAS-plot are tailored for DFT utilities. And functions and operations are available to meet 
frequent requirements of a DFT user.

- New tables can be created.
- Data can be imported to these tables from files with DAT/CSV formats.
- Both plain CSV and nested CSV(:numref:`plot5`) are supported in CINEMAS-plot.

   CINEMAS-plot tables: Nested CSV loaded as a table, See column #5.


- Data from CINEMAS-plot tables can be exported to CSV/DAT file formats.
- Cells, rows, columns, or regions within a table can be highlighted for references or discussion purposes(:numref:`plot1`, :numref:`plot2`).
- Change of color available for both, background as well as fonts.

   CINEMAS-plot table: color highlighting and available statistical operations.

- Several operations and functions are available for tables. 
- There are general but advantageous operations. See :numref:`plot4`,
- There are statistical operations available. See :numref:`plot2`.

   CINEMAS-plot table: Available options for tables.

- Both the tables and the graphs, can go full-screen for views and work both. See :numref:`plot2`, :numref:`plot3`.

CINEMAS-plot graphs
====================

Numeric data from the table(s) can be plotted as several types of graphs:

- Line
- Line + scatter
- Scatter
- Histogram
- Pie chart
- Bar plots(Row/Column)

Graphs can be exported to .jpg/.png format with scaling up-to 20X, and vector formats like .ps/.eps/.pdf.
