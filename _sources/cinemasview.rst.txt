*CINEMAS-view* is and integrated structure visualizer, which can be used not only to visualize a structure and volumetric data, but to modify it and write it to a file in several formats. Current version of CINEMAS supports loading and inter-conversion of CIF, XSF, POSCAR and .vasp (VASP) and .in(Quantum espresso) formats. CIF formats are handled by use of `Pymatgen <https://pymatgen.org/>`_ libraries.

Structure Visualizer
====================

*CINEMAS-view* reads all the workflows created within CASCADE, and reads & loads all the compatible files for visualization(for VASP: POSCAR/CONTCAR/CHGCAR/ELFCAR/PARCHG). 

For volumetric data, *CINEMAS-view* can make difference of two files with asymmetric grid density, visualize and save the interpolated files.

Though not directly a part of CINEMAS-view, from *input-files:k-points* workspace Brillouin zone can be visualized for any given 
structure. Desires k-path can be selected on the screen and corresponding coordinates are exported to KPOINTS(for VASP) file for 
band-structure calculations.

Structure Manager
==================

Structure-manager is the most important feature of CINEMAS-view. It can be envoked by |surf| icon from CINEMAS-view toolbar. It allows to manipulate the input structure with respect to various symmetry operations and write it to file. Following functions are available currently with Structure-manager.

- Read the given structure and cleave the surface for desired Miller indices.
- Choose in-plane vectors for direction as well as repetition.
- Miller indices of in-plane vectors are updated as the arrow is moved and released.
- Create surface cell in different geometry as 'Periodic and normal', 'Periodic bulk like(with minimum atoms)' or 'Non-periodic(to create surface slabs)'.
- Increase/decrease number of layers in slab, either by layer-by-layer mode or by giving thickness(either no. of layers or in Angstroms).
- Apply mirror symmetry along XY, YZ or XZ planes.
- Add adsorbate molecules directly.
- Translate or rotate adsorbate molecule by mouse or keyboard.
- Restrict degree of freedom for layers or atoms for atomic relaxation(Selective Dynamics for VASP).
- Add or substitute atoms in the cell.
- Scalar/vector type supercell can be created. For example, :math:`2\times2\times 1` or :math:`\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}\times 1` type of supercell. 


A video tutorial is available `here <https://youtu.be/GcWaBmAIXYA>`_, on how to create a surface cell or slab from any bulk cell.

Fermi Surface Visualizer
========================

If a valid calculation for Fermi-surface exists, CINEMAS can automatically read the calculation workflow and display Fermi-surface for the choice of bands selected. High quality graphics can be exported for publication purpose.

Below is one example of Fermi-surface for non-magnetic Al in its bulk structure.

From CINEMAS-view, button 'FS' invokes 'Fermi-surface' and a dialogue box displays information regarding the calculation. CINEMAS can selectively display Fermi-surface for a single or a group of bands:

   :scale: 90%

   Fermi-surface: Prompting information about parsed calculation.

According to the selection, Fermi-surface is displayed for individual band(s) as well as for the combination. Fermi-surfaces for individual bands can be visualized in different schemes as in 1) reciprocal unit cell, 2) BZ or 3) repeated surface in BZ. Following figures display the Fermi-surface for band #2 and #3, as well as a merged view of both.

Robocrystallographer
====================

`Robocrystallographer <https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/robocrystallographer/index.html>`_, a Python based external package with a command-line interface 
is graphically integrated to 
the CINEMAS-view. This tool generates text description of a given structure. CINEMAS-view provides a seamless graphical interface to this otherwise 
command-line based package. CINEMAS-view displays the text description of the structure 
displayed in the active tab, which is generated by Robocrystallographer. All the usage-options originally available for this 
package are integrated to its GUI in CINEMAS-view. Below are some snapshots of the usage of CINEMAS-view's GUI to 
Robocrystallographer. 

Figure below shows description of a structure in Latex format with default options of robocrystallographer package.

Visualize magnetic configuration
==================================

CINEMAS can visualize collinear or non-collinear magnetic configuration automatically from a workflow, if it contains valid calculation and respective files.
This requires no re-formatting of files. Display can be easily toggled between ordering from input or that from the output, for easy comparison.
Double-click on arrows instantly displays the value of magnetic moment.
Appearance of arrows representing a magnetic ordering, can be completely customized and exported to 
graphics of publication-standard.

Visualize forces on a computes structure
==========================================

CINEMAS can display forces on a computed structure directly by loading a workflow containing a valid calculation and respective files. As a universal behavior this 
requires no re-formatting. And forces can be visualized automatically. 
Complete customization of appearance is available to export publication-standard graphics.
