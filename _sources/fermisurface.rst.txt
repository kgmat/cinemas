How to visualize Fermi-surface in CINEMAS
========================================================================

CINEMAS can visualize Fermi-surface in its component CINEMAS-view.

Fermi-surface calculation can be performed using CINEMAS, and then CINEMAS-view can display 3D Fermi-surface automatically from VASP output files.

Alternatively, a folder containing VASP files of a Fermi-surface calculation can be imported to CINEMAS, and then 3D Fermi-surface can be visualized in CINEMAS-view.

Examples of Nonmagnetic Al
============================

- :numref:`al_fermi_calc` shows a workflow loaded in CINEMAS. This calculation could be performed within CINEMAS, or imported to CINEMAS.

   Workflow displaying a Fermi-surface calculation for *Al-Nonmagnetic* in CASCADE.

- Once can switch to CINEMAS-view by clicking the icon on the workflow or directly as highlighted in :numref:`switch_view_fs`

   Switch to CINEMAS-view to view Fermi-surface there.

- Left pan on CINEMAS-view, shows a tree of workflows and list of files supported by CINEMAS-view therein.
- Visualization need not to be set for **POSCAR** necessarily for Fermi-surface visualization.
- Any file(*POSCAR/CONTCAR/PARCHG/LOCPOT/ELFCAR/CHGCAR*) can be visualized from the workflow, *Al-Nonmagnetic* in this example(See :numref:`invoke-fs`).

   CINEMAS-view displaying the structure from the workflow *Al-Nonmagnetic* from CASCADE.

- **Fermi-surface** workspace can be invoked by the button **FS** as highlighted in the :numref:`invoke-fs` or :numref:`fs1`.

   Invoking *Fermi-surface* workspace from the CINEMAS-view toolbar.

- Invoking Fermi-surface workspace, prompts a window as shown in :numref:`fs1`. This displays a few informations about the system, in this example **Al-Nonmagnetic**:

    * No. of band. 
    * The value of Fermi-energy.
    * Type of system: Magnetic or Non-Magnetic.
    * Bands crossing or NOT crossing Fermi-level, along with respective band indices

- :numref:`bandselect` shows how different options can be selected to visualize Fermi-surface.

    * :numref:`bandselect`-(a): All the bands crossing Fermi-level can be selected for visualization.
    * :numref:`bandselect`-(b): Selective bands crossing Fermi-level can be selected for visualization.
    * :numref:`bandselect`-(c): Selective bands crossing or not crossing Fermi-level can be selected together for visualization.

   Different ways to select bands to visualize Fermi-surface for.

- For this example, options as shown in :numref:`bandselect`-(a) are selected.
- By clicking the **OK** button, CINEMAS-view switches to Fermi-surface visualization, as shown in the :numref:`fsscreen`.
- Since, options as shown in the :numref:`bandselect`-(a) were selected with two bands #2 and #3 crossing the Fermi-level.
- First tab displays 3D Fermi-surface for band #2.
- Second tab displays 3D Fermi-surface for band #3.
- Third tab displays a merged view of band #2 and #3 together(see :numref:`fsscreen`).

   Fermi-surface for individual band #2.

- On the right side, from **Style Options**, view-mode can be changed, or different style-settings can be applied.

- For individual bands, default mode of visualization is **Surface in reciprocal unitcell** (:numref:`fsscreen`).
- Mode can be changed to **Surface in BZ** (:numref:`surfinbz`). BZ stands for Brillouin Zone.

   Fermi-surface for individual band #2, in *surface in BZ* mode.

- Another mode is **Repeated surface in BZ** (:numref:`repeatbz`).

   :name: repeatbz
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Fermi-surface for individual band #2, in *Repeated surface in BZ* mode.

- :numref:`band3` displays Fermi-surface for band #3, and modes or style-settings can be changed from **Style Options**.

.. figure:: _static/fermi_surface_12.png
   :name: band3
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Fermi-surface for individual band #3.

- :numref:`fsmerged` displays merged view of Fermi-surfaces for band #2, and #3. 
- Multiple, Line/Color properties can be changed/applied from the **Style Options** as shown on the right side of the Fermi-surface visualizer.

.. figure:: _static/fermi_surface_13.png
   :name: fsmerged
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

   Merged view of Fermi-surfaces for band #2, and #3.

- For example, for band #2, and #3 Fermi surface can be shown as wired type instead of solid type of surface(see :numref:`fswire1` and :numref:`fswire2`).
- Importantly, from **Style Options**, *Interpolate* slider can be used to interpolate Fermi-surface data points, to make surface look smoother.
- CINEMAS supports interplolation upto 6X.

- Finally, by a single click on the button |send2draw|, graphics from the Fermi-surface visualizer can be exported to CINEMAS-draw to create a figure of publication-standard.
- Graphics from the screen as shown in the :numref:`fsmerged` is exported to CINEMAS-draw as shown in the :numref:`fs2draw`.
- Text-box and the effects are added additionally.

   One-click export of graphics from Fermi-surface viewer to CINEMAS-draw to futher prepare figure of publication-standards. Text box is added separately.

- Fermi-surface visualized within CINEMAS for 1) Nonmagnetic Aluminium :numref:`fermi-1`, 2) Nonmagnetic Copper :numref:`fermi-2`, and 3) Nonmagnetic Titanium :numref:`fermi-3`.
