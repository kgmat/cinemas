=========================================================================
How to visualize forces on atoms from a computed structure(*Force-View*)
=========================================================================

- CINEMAS can visualize the forces('TOTAL-FORCE' from OUTCAR file for VASP code) directly from the output files.
- From a workflow containing valid files, if a structure is visualized in CINEMAS-view.
- One can go to **Force-view** tab in *Style option* on the right side of the CINEMAS-view window.
- If workflow contains an erroneous calculation, CINEMAS will not find any valid forces, and **Mag-view** category will remain disabled.
- Appearance of arrows can be customized collectively, for individual species.
- Arrow/tip length/radius can be scaled.
- Arrow/tip color can be changed. 

- Additionally, by double-click on an arrow, displays the value of the force-vector for a particular species.

   'Force-view' in CINEMAS-view, visualizing forces on a computed structure.

   Double-click on an arrow displays the vector representing the force on a species.

   Color properties, arrow/tip length or radius can be changed as per user-requirements.

   **Force-view** category in the *Style options* within CINEMAS-view. Different properties can be controlled from here.

   Atom-resolved properties can also be set for 'force-arrows'.

   An example of a workflow containing only input files. So OUTCAR is not present and **Force-view** category is disabled automatically.

.. figure:: _static/force7.png
   :name: force7
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
   
   An example where the workflow contains valid and complete calculation, but forces are **Zero**. Category is enabled, but no arrows are displayed in this case.
