    Introduction
    ==============

There has been a paradigm shift in the last few years, in the domain of computational materials science. 
Efficient computational resources are enabling researchers to generate a large amount of data. Moreover, 
advancement in data science techniques is making it possible to interpret a large amount of data for 
certain materials property as well as predicting new materials. A number of highly efficient applications 
are being developed to handle a huge number of calculations altogether.

CINEMAS has been conceptualized to facilitate calculations through an easy-to-use integrated graphical 
user interface(GUI). CINEMAS can prepare, execute, and manage tens of thousands of calculations from a single canvas. 
CINEMAS can perform Density Functional Theory(DFT) calculations 
primarily and also secondary calculations additionally, using DFT output data. Several required tools 
such as visualizer, plotter, connections, file-transfer, drawing are stitched together to build CINEMAS 
as an integrated efficient-GUI based platform.

CINEMAS has the same design for its user-interface, screenshots from the supported OSs(Windows,Linux, and MacOS) are shown throughout the documentation.
