How to create input files?
============================

Input-file preparation dialogue box creates files in the order of **Structure-->K-points-->Potential-->Instructions**, which in the case of VASP
translates to the order **POSCAR-->KPOINTs-->POTCAR-->INCAR**.

1) **Structure:**

- CINEMAS can create a structure file from the scratch by taking symmetry and site information, or load structure files from several formats such as .xsf(XCrysden), .vasp(VASP), .in(Quantum Espresso), .cif and etc. Generation of a structure from the scratch is performed using :ref:`spglib<Spglib license>`, while cif format is handled using :ref:`pymatgen<Pymatgen license>` libraries. 

- Once symmetry/site data or a file-form-disk is exported, further atomic sites can be added or deleted or degree-of-freedom for structural relaxation can be restricted(the same can be done from :ref:`structure manager<Structure Manager>` side as well).

   Input-files: Restrict degree of freedom by selecting 'selective dynamics' at the left bottom, and check the boxes to restrict the atom.

   Input-files: Alternatively load structure file from different formats.


2) **K-points:**

From the second tab, K-points file can be created in two modes: either in automatic or band-structure mode. Automatic mode is self-explanatory, while for the band-structure mode, using icon Brillouin zone for any loaded structure can be visualized, k-path be selected and corresponding co-ordinates are exported and K-points file is created. In the current version of CINEMAS, only high symmetry points are exported and labeling has to be done manually.

   Input-files: Create K-points for band-structure calculations.

   Input-files: For band-structure, visualize BZ and select k-path and export corresponding co-ordinates. In current version labeling of high-symmetry points has be done manually.

3) **Potentials:**

From the third tab, type of potential(LDA/GGA-PW91/GGA-PBE) can be chosen as well as available option of potentials with different valence. Above holds true if potential files have been :ref:`configured<Potential-files configuration>` already.

   Input-files: Select potentials for respective atomic species.

4) **Instructions:**

From the fourth tab, instructions-file(INCAR for VASP) can be prepared, essentially telling DFT-engine(VASP) what to do. CINEMAS can prepare instruction-file in graphical, as well as text mode. All possible code-specific tags have been divided into several categories to help a user lesser experienced with the DFT-code. These categories are further distributed over different user levels such as basic/intermediate/expert. Alternatively expert users can directly type the file in text mode. Additionally any other instruction file can be loaded and modified, or saved for repetitive use in future.
