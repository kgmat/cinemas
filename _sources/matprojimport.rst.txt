How to import input-files/data from Materials-project database
========================================================================

- CINEMAS has a graphical interface to the `Materials-project database <https://materialsproject.org/>`_.
- Using an `API key <https://materialsproject.org/dashboard>`_ generated on Materials-project website, their database can be accessed fro CINEMAS.
- In the current version of CINEMAS, VASP input-files or structures in CIF formats can be imported to CINEMAS or exported to disk.

Materials-project interface
============================
- Materials-project interface can be invoked from the menu ``Import >> From Materials Project`` from the CASCADE screen(see :numref:`invoke-mp`).

- This leads to a window as shown in the :numref:`mpscreen1`

- Symbol-buttons from the periodic table, can be used to enter the elements of a composition or the same can be typed.
- An API-key is required to be able to perform a search for a composition.
- Without API-key, if a composition is searched *e.g.* Na-Cl, it will prompt for an API-key(See :numref:`api-prompt`).

- If an API key is not fed in, search will be declined with an error message, as shown in :numref:`api-error`.

- A valid API-key which can be generated from `materialsproject website <https://materialsproject.org/dashboard>`_, has to be entered to query the materialsproject database(:numref:`enter-key`).

- With a valid key, interface queries the database for a given composition, as shown in :numref:`searching`.

- For a given composition, the database returns multiple entries with a 'materials-id' for each of them(see :numref:`search-return`).

- An entry of interest can be selected by a mouse click and its corresponding structure is shown in CIF format, as shown in :numref:`select-entry`.

- Using |impall| button, set of VASP input files can be imported to CINEMAS as a workflow(see :numref:`impallcinemas`). Which can be further used for a desired calculation.

- Please note, as VASP potential files(POTAR) are licensed, materialsproject provides only information about POTCAR, but actually does not provide a POTCAR file unlike INCAR,POSCAR, and KPOINTS files.

- If potential files have been configured within CINEMAS environment as shown in :numref:`potcarauto1`, a POTCAR file will be generated automatically by CINEMAS automatically(:numref:`potcarauto2`).

- Using |downall| button, set of VASP input files can be saved on the disk.
- Using |impcif| button, only the structure from a 'materials-id' can be imported as a workflow in CINEMAS.
- :numref:`impcifcinemas` shows importing a cif file from materialsproject as a workflow in CINEMAS.
