Phonopy from scratch using a structure file
===========================================

*       **Initiate Phonopy module:** Phonopy module can be initiated from CASCADE toolbar by clicking XXX icon.

                :align: center
                :scale: 70%

                Invoke Phonopy module, and choose mode.

*       **Load the structure:** browse the structure file from disk. In the current version of CINEMAS supported structure 
        file formats are :math:`\texttt{POSCAR/*.vasp/*.cif/*.in/*.xsf}`. 
   
*       **Choose method/property for Phonopy run:**

                :align: center
                :scale: 70%

                Invoke Phonopy module, and choose mode.



*       **Settings for input-files:**

        - In :numref:`phonopyincar1`, the first field is a list of established connections.
        - In 'default' mode workflow is submitted automatically to a connection marked as default in *connection* workspace. 
        - In *default* mode, all the setting fields will be disabled and show parameters in 'read-only' mode. 
        - Setting mode has to be changed to *user* mode to make customized settings. 
        - In the *user* mode of settings, remote server can be selected from a list of established connections as show in the figure below. 
        - As well as all the setting fields can be set to desired parameters. 
        - Additionally *Save* and *Load* buttons are enabled, and can be used to save user-settings as a template or to load a saved one.

*       **Automatic creation of workflows:**
        - Workflows are created for the choice selected for method/property.
        - For DFPT method, a module with a single workflow is created.

                :name: phonopy2

                Automatic workflows creation for DFPT method.

        - For Finite-Difference method, a module with several(depending uplong supercell size) workflows is created.

                Automatic workflows creation for a :math:`2\times2\times2` supercell of :math:`\mathrm{NaCl}` using finite-difference method.

*       **Automatic submission and download:**.

        - Once workflows created, CINEMAS submits the same to a remote connection marked as *default* in Connections workspace.
        - A different connection other than *defult* can be selected, as discussed in the previous step *settings*.

*       **Phonopy post-processing:** 

                - Invoke Phonopy-post-processing workspace by clicking the incon XXX.
                - Select type of the calculation *i.e.* Band, DOS, or Band & DOS.
                - Click *Run* button, to run an instance of Phonopy program.
                - A success or an error message will be displayed above the *Run* button.
                - Just of the information both of the messages are shown together, in :numref:`phonopy-post1`.
                  In a real case, either of them will be displayed.
                - *Run* button exectues an instance of 'phonoppy' command. 
                - *View* button shows a Matplotlib-graph (equivalent of adding an argument **-p** in command-line usage of Phonopy) using the output of Phonopy execution. However, this is a 'view-only' graph. See :numref:`phonopy-post2`.
                - *Load in CINEMAS* button reformats the output(from YAML format by default or from HDF5 by choice) of the phonopy-execution and loads a formatted table and a graph into CINEMAS-plot. See :numref:`phonopy-post4`. 
                - The loaded graph in CINEAMS-plot, is further available for user-desired customizations, and to prepare and export a publication-quality figure.
                - *View logs* button opens the output logs of Phonopy program in a native application installed for text files.

*       **Generation of coordinates and labels of high-symmetry points:**

        Especially for phonon bandstructure, there are three modes to provide coordinates of high-symmetry points
        in the Brillouin zone, **Manual**, **Pymatgen-auto**, and **Phonopy-auto**. In the *Manual* mode, the user has to provide 
        coordinates and labels of each high-symmetry point to be considered in the Phonopy calculation. In *Cinemas-auto* mode coordinates and lables of high-symmetry 
        points are generated by `Pymatgen <https://pymatgen.org/pymatgen.symmetry.bandstructure.html#pymatgen.symmetry.bandstructure.HighSymmKpath>`_ package and shown in the Phonopy-postprocess workspace, while for *Phonopy-auto* mode this is done by 
        `Seekpath <https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath>`_ program, which is the original behavior of command-line Phonopy.
