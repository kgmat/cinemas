How to setup connections between the local machine and a remote server?
========================================================================

- Click *Connection* from the main menubar of the CINEMAS screen. See :numref:`conn`
- **Manage SSH connections** leads to *Connections* workspace, where remote connections can be set up.

- For the first time set-up, or starting over *Connections* workspace screen appears as shown in :numref:`conn-3`.

- The button **Add connections** adds a new connection with a choice of job-scheduler.
   
   * Connection$i$ is the default connec-name. **i** is the number of connection.
   * **Set as default** can be marked for a connection, to which automatic-modules will submit calculations if there are more than one connections established.  
   * The current version of CINEMAS supports TORQUE, MOAB, OTP-type and localhost(VASP installed without any scheduler).
   * Along with the choice of scheduler, a connection to remote-server can be established by entering IP address, and user credentials by clicking |connect| button.
   * See :numref:`conn-4`, :numref:`conn-5`, and :numref:`conn-6`.

- Once the connection is established(:numref:`conn-7`), remote-server-location, submit-command, and submit-script(if any) has to be defined.  

   * **Remote-server location:** User has to define remote-server-location. *e.g.* /home/username/CINEMAS/ or similar.
   * **Submit command:** User has to define command along with arguments if any. *E.g.* qsub/msub/*'mpirun -np 4 vasp > vasp.out &'*.
   * **Submit script:** If it is needed, browse the script to submit a calculation on the remote-server.
   * **Save:** The *Save* button can be used to save a connection with user-credentials, command, submit-script path.
   * **Load connections:** This button loads a previously saved connections.
   * **Auto connect:** This check-box can be ticked, if CINEMAS should load all the connections saved, right after it launches.
   * :numref:`conn-8` shows a case of established connection, will all required details filled in.

- **Multi-hop connections:** At times, for various reasons(security primarily) connection to a remote compute-server is established through gateway-server(s).
   
   * By clicking |addconn| button next to IP address of an established connection, one more *server* field appears(:numref:`conn-9`). 
   * As explained in previous steps, by providing IP, and user-credentials another connection can be established hopping through the previous connection(:numref:`conn-10`).
   * :numref:`conn-11` is a scenario of a connection to remote compute-server established by hopping through two gateways.

- **Load connections:** 

   * If saved earlier, connection can be established by loading the details.
   * This can be done manually(:numref:`conn-12`) by clicking *Load connection* button, or automatically if *auto connect* was checked.

- :numref:`conn-13` shows two connections established. 
- Any number of connections can be established between local machine and multiple remote servers.
- A calculation can be readily submitted to a choice of compute-server. See :numref:`conn-14`.
