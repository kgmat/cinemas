============================
How to start with CINEMAS
============================

One can start with CINEMAS in multiple ways:

1) By creating a new CINEMAS project.
2) By opening an existing CINEMAS project.
3) By loading DFT-engine(as of now VASP) input and selected output files in CINEMAS.
4) By importing existing calculation(s) from the disk.
5) By importing VASP-input files to CINEMAS from materials-project interface.

Create/open a new CINEMAS project
===================================

A new CINEMAS project can be created from *File* menu by clicking **Create project** or short-cut key **Ctrl+N**.

   Creating a new CINEMAS project.

Once a project is created, on **CASCADE** window icon |adddisabled| becomes active as |addactive| and empty workflows can be created by clicking the same. Functions of workflow icon can be found :ref:`here<Workflows>`.

From the workflows, :ref:`input files can be created<How to create input files?>`, visualized and calculations can be executed over a :ref:`remote compute-server with a valid connection<Establish connection to remote server(s)>`.



Load DFT-engine input/output file(s)
======================================

   Starting by opening DFT-engine based input/output file.

   Supported formats for opening input/output files.


Import existing calculation(s)
===============================

:ref:`CINEMAS can import directories<From disk>` containing existing calculations. User can further analyze/re-do the calculations.


Import VASP input files from materials-project to CINEMAS
===========================================================

CINEMAS can also :ref:`import VASP input files or import structure from Materials-project<From Materials-project>`. User can start again from these input files.
